# Modeling data with YANG
https://developer.cisco.com/learning/tracks/get_started_with_nso/nso-labs/yang-nso-201/creating-a-new-model/ 

## Create a Service Package: 

You will  need a package that holds your YANG model (or models). 
The simplest way to do so is by creating a service package with the ncs-make-package command,

    cd packages && ncs-make-package --service-skeleton template my-models

NSO can't use YANG files in their original form, they have to be compiled first. The ncs-make-package command created my-models/src/_directory that holds all the files that need compilation, and a Makefile. The Makefile contains the recipes to easily build the source files. It instructs the make command to look for all the YANG files under the src/yang/ path and compile them into an NSO-compatible (binary) format.

The ncs-make-package command also creates some additional files that you will not be needing. Using the rm command, remove the following files:

    rm -f my-models/templates/* my-models/src/yang/*
    cd my-models/src/yang 

## Create a New Model

###Â Define a YANG module

Sample yang module: (You can find the explanations of the data-types etc. below the yang module) 

    module ip-access-list {
      namespace "http://example.com/ns/yang/ip-access-list";
      prefix acl;
    
      import ietf-inet-types {
        prefix inet;
      }
    
      organization
        "Example, Inc.";
    
      contact
        "Example, Inc.
         Customer Service
         E-mail: cs-yang@example.org";
    
      description
        "Access Control List (ACL) YANG model.";
    
      revision 2021-07-06 {
        description
          "Initial revision";
      }
    
      typedef port-type {
        type union {
          type uint16 {
            range "0..65535";
          }
          type enumeration {
            enum "ssh" {value 22;}
            enum "telnet" {value 23;}
            enum "https" {value 443;}
            enum "http" {value 80;}
            enum "ftp" {value 21;}
            enum "pop3" {value 110;}
            enum "smtp" {value 25;}
            enum "tftp" {value 69;}
            enum "domain" {value 53;}
            enum "ntp" {value 123;}
          }
        }
      }
       // ...
      container acl {
        description
          "Access Control Lists";
          leaf acl-description{
            type string{
            length  "0..64";
            pattern "[0-9a-zA-Z]*";
            }
            description "Purpose of ACL";
          }
          leaf-list maintainers {
            type string;
            description "Name of maintainers working on the ACL";
          }
          list entry {
              key "number";
              leaf number {
                  type uint16;
              }
              description "Sequence number of an ACE";
              leaf action {
                  type enumeration {
                      enum permit;
                      enum deny;
                 }
                  description "Action to take with the packet";
              }
              leaf source-ip {
                  type inet:ipv4-address; 
                  description "Source IPv4 address.";
              }
              leaf destination-ip {
                  type inet:ipv4-address;
                  description "Destination IPv4 address.";
              }
              leaf destination-port {
                  type port-type;
              }
          }
      }
    }

On the example think of "list" as a dictionary in python, it has key and the value part. 
When you want to limit a number of options, you can use the enumeration statement, like "permit/deny" in the example above

The NSO installation folder contains many useful YANG modules, which consist of custom predefined YANG data types. For example, the ietf-inet-types holds a group of commonly used predefined YANG data types for addresses and other internet-related objects and features. It is imported in the example above right after "prefix" with "import ietf-inet-types......" and "ietf:ipv4-address" type is used for ip address entry in the acl. 

Sometimes, built-in YANG data types do not suit your needs, and you are unable to find modules that you can import with suitable data types. In this case, you can build your own.The typedef statement describes a data type that is derived from a base types and supports a hierarchy of derived types. The base type can be a derived type itself or a YANG built-in type. You can use the derived type as an argument for the type statement. The typedef statements are positioned just after the revision statement.


A useful tool that you can use to check that the validity of a YANG syntax is pyang.If there are errors in the file, they are displayed in the output, receiving no output means that all is well. 

    pyang --strict ip-access-list.yang
    
Your module is starting to take shape but you will must compile it before NSO can use it 

    (py3venv) [developer@devbox yang]$ make -C ..
    /home/developer/nso/bin/ncsc  `ls ip-access-list-ann.yang  > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "-a ip-access-list-ann.yang"` \
                  -c -o ../load-dir/ip-access-list.fxs yang/ip-access-list.yang

The output should not contain any errors. If there are any, update the YANG file before continuing.
